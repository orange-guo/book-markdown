  <br/>In computer security, challenge-response authentication is a set of protocols used to protect digital assets and
  services from unauthorized users, programs or activities. While challenge-response authentication can be as simple as
  a password, it can also be as dynamic as a randomly generated request. From login verification to machine learning (
  ML), challenge-response authentication is an easy-to-implement cybersecurity tool to secure sensitive information,
  identify suspicious behavior or block certain programs.
