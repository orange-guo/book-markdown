# Projects

- [unsnap](https://github.com/popey/unsnap)
  <br/>Quickly migrate from using snap packages to flatpaks
- [omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub)
  <br/>Turn a fresh Ubuntu installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running
  a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omakub. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just
  to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omakub is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at
  its best.
