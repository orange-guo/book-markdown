- [How to Install Wine on Linux](https://wine.htmlvalidator.com/)
  <br/>On this site will be found tutorials showing how to install Wine, a compatibility layer that enables a Linux
  distribution to run Windows applications as if they were native Linux applications.
  <br/>Your Linux distribution may include Wine in its repositories, but that version of Wine may not be the latest
  stable version, or perhaps you want or need a development or staging version of Wine. Or Wine may not be included in
  your distribution's repositories. For any of these situations, this site's procedures for manual installation of Wine
  will be helpful.
