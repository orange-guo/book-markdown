# Spring

## Libraries

- [spring-boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
  <br/>Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just
  run".
  <br/>We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum
  fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.
  <br/>If you’re looking for information about a specific version, or instructions about how to upgrade from an earlier
  release, check out the project release notes section on our wiki.
- [spring-integration](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration)
  <br/>Spring Integration provides an extension of the Spring programming model to support the well-known Enterprise
  Integration Patterns (EIP)
- [spring-modulith](https://spring.io/projects/spring-modulith)
  <br/>Spring Modulith allows developers to build well-structured Spring Boot applications and guides developers in
  finding and working with application modules driven by the domain. It supports the verification of such modular
  arrangements, integration testing individual modules, observing the application’s behavior on the module level and
  creating documentation snippets based on the arrangement created.
